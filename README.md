# OOPS-in-CPP

## NOTES from GFG

In C++, polymorphism can be of three types:

Operator Overloading: The process of making an operator exhibit different behaviours in different instances is known as operator overloading.

Function Overloading: Function overloading is using a single function name to perform different types of tasks.

Function Overriding: Function overriding is changing the behaviour of a function that is derived from the base class using inheritance.
